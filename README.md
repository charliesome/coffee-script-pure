# coffee-script-pure

**coffee-script-pure** is a CoffeeScript compiler running in pure Ruby. It adopts the same protocol as [ruby-coffee-script](https://github.com/josh/ruby-coffee-script):

    require "coffee-script-pure"
    CoffeeScript.compile "console.log 'hello world'", bare: true
      # => "\nconsole.log('hello world');\n"

coffee-script-pure uses the [Twostroke](https://github.com/charliesome/twostroke) - a Javascript interpreter written in Ruby. A compiled and deflated copy of the CoffeeScript compiler is bundled with coffee-script-pure. The Twostroke VM and CoffeeScript environment is initialized the first time you compile script.

## Installation

    gem install coffee-script-pure
